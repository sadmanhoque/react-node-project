# react-node-project
Sample react-node project for full stack applications.

# TODO
* Check the usage of nodemon
* Integration of custom modules
* More research on difference between app.use and app.get or any other REST method

# Reference
Following this site to get started on the backend server aspect, but ignore the REST client configuration since I want a separate React front-end server for that. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-tutorial-rest-client-rest-service-and-api-calls-explained-with-code-examples/
